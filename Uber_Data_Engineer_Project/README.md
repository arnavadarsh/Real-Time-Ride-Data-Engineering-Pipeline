# RideStream: End-to-End Azure Data Engineering Pipeline

An end-to-end **cloud-based data engineering pipeline** built on **Microsoft Azure** to process real-time and batch ride-streaming data.  
The pipeline follows the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** and enables scalable ingestion, transformation, and analytics-ready modeling.

This project demonstrates modern **Data Engineering practices including streaming ingestion, ETL pipelines, Delta Lake processing, and dimensional modeling.**

---

# Architecture Overview

The system processes data from multiple sources and transforms it into analytics-ready datasets using Azure services.

### Core Flow

```
User App → Azure Function → Event Hub → Azure Databricks (Spark)
                                         ↓
GitHub → Azure Data Factory → ADLS Gen2 →
                                         ↓
                                Delta Processing
                                         ↓
                           Gold Layer (Star Schema)
                                         ↓
                                   Analytics
